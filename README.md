# LogisticFAR

This package implements the **F**unctional **C**ompositional data **Q**uadratic **M**ethod(FCQM) algorithm proposed in the paper `Biomarker Detection for Disease Classification in Longitudinal Microbiome Data`. This is a logistic functional additive regression with log-contrast constrain.

## Installation

You can use `remotes` to directly install the latest version from Github.

```r
#install.packages("devtools")
remotes::install_github("fenguoerbian/LogisticFAR")
```

If you've installed `devtools`, then `remotes` should have already been installed.

## Example

A toy example is to be added.
